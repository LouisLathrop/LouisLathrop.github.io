            <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying at Ozark Technical Community College, working to achieve an associates degree in Computer Information Systems. I would love to take the skills that I learn from this degree to maintain and develop large scale web apps. I work full time as a Training Supervisor for a large company during the day, going to school part time and making room for my education online and in the evenings.  I live with my girlfriend, our 10 year old son, and our 14 year old cat "Romeo".  We love to spend our weekends during the spring and summer on the water, either fishing on one of the many lakes in the area, or kayaking one of the local rivers. In the fall and winter we love to decorate our house for Halloween and Christmas.</p>
