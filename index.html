            <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
            <br>            
            <p>I have always had an interest in all things computing. From editing resource files on my schools Apple Mac in the 90's, to making a website for my some gaming groups in the early 2000's I've always been curious about the capabiiltes of computing and web technology. After over a decade of gaining valuable experience as a leader in customer service and sales roles, I decided it was time for a career change.  I decided to pursue a serious and structured approach to learning about the concepts that interested me in my teens. It was time to go back to my roots and learn how to build computer and web applications! While technology has certainly come a long way, it was not to late for me to learn these new tricks! I successfuly completed an Associates degree program at my local community college in May of 2024, learning so much about what powers the desktop, mobile, and internet applications of today.  It was an amazing opportunity, and I'm so glad I was able to complete the journey at this stage of my life!</p>
